I love the idea of just carrying a paper / pen to write thoughts as they come,
but there's no way I can write fast enough to keep up.  There's no way I would
have produced this email if I were writing with a pen instead of typing.

I would have gotten frustrated and stopped typing.  I would have been trying to
write down the thoughts I had minutes ago, their memories leaking, fading.  I
couldn't play with thought-tangents, because I'd be working to capture ideas of
the past.

Maybe I should learn journalists' shorthand.
